# 2DGameEngine

Must Haves:

-> Resolution Independence
-> Convert to DLL
-> Support for actually being able to use this as a library
-> Separate rendering thread from game logic thread 
   (or an alternate solution to the problem that the fps is more or less directly tied to the speed of the game.)

Could Haves:

-> Framerate counter
-> OpenGL Renderer for Mac and Linux support
